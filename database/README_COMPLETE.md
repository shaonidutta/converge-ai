WHERE response_overdue = TRUE OR resolution_overdue = TRUE
ORDER BY priority DESC, hours_open DESC;
```

## 🔍 Analytics Queries

### Complaint Metrics
```sql
-- Complaints by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM complaints
GROUP BY status;

-- Complaints by priority
SELECT priority, COUNT(*) as count
FROM complaints
GROUP BY priority;

-- Average resolution time by priority
SELECT 
    priority,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, created_at, resolved_at)) as avg_hours_to_resolve,
    COUNT(*) as total_resolved
FROM complaints
WHERE status = 'resolved'
GROUP BY priority;

-- SLA compliance rate
SELECT 
    priority,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN resolved_at <= resolution_due_at THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as within_sla,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN resolved_at <= resolution_due_at THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as sla_compliance_pct
FROM complaints
WHERE status = 'resolved'
GROUP BY priority;

-- Top complaint types
SELECT 
    complaint_type,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, created_at, resolved_at)) as avg_resolution_hours
FROM complaints
WHERE status = 'resolved'
GROUP BY complaint_type
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Support team performance
SELECT 
    u.first_name,
    COUNT(c.id) as complaints_handled,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, c.created_at, c.resolved_at)) as avg_resolution_hours,
    SUM(CASE WHEN c.resolved_at <= c.resolution_due_at THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as within_sla
FROM complaints c
JOIN users u ON c.resolved_by = u.id
WHERE c.status = 'resolved'
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY complaints_handled DESC;

## 🔧 Database Maintenance

### Backup
```bash
# Full backup
mysqldump -u root -p convergeai > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Schema only
mysqldump -u root -p --no-data convergeai > schema_backup.sql
```

### Restore
```bash
mysql -u root -p convergeai < backup_20250105.sql
```

### Optimize
```sql
-- Analyze tables
ANALYZE TABLE complaints, complaint_updates, bookings, conversations;

-- Optimize tables
OPTIMIZE TABLE complaints, complaint_updates, bookings, conversations;
```

---

## 🔐 Security Setup

### Create Application User
```sql
CREATE USER 'convergeai_app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password_here';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON convergeai.* TO 'convergeai_app'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Create Read-Only User (Analytics)
```sql
CREATE USER 'convergeai_readonly'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'readonly_password';
GRANT SELECT ON convergeai.* TO 'convergeai_readonly'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Indexes
All critical indexes are already in place:
- Foreign keys indexed
- Status fields indexed
- Date fields indexed
- Composite indexes for common queries
- SLA deadline fields indexed

### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Use views for complex queries
SELECT * FROM v_open_complaints;

-- Use indexes in WHERE clauses
SELECT * FROM complaints WHERE status = 'open' AND priority = 'high';

-- Limit results for large tables
SELECT * FROM conversations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;
```
